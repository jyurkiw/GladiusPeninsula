The Principality's original seat of power.
The palace was abandoned when the old empire was collapsing and imperial forces marched on the newly independent principality. The first prince was the leader of the separatist forces that led the fight for independence and the capitol was moved to the western fortress after Nice and Mec√© both fell.
Ilse is now known for it's vinyards and wines.

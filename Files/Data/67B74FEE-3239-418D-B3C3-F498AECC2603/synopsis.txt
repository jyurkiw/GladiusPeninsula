Capitol of the Principality.
Ruled by an elected royal family that sits for life.
The prince sits between the Mage council and the church of steel and acts as arbiter.
Current prince favors the Powder Guild over the magic users, and this is causing political tumoral.
City is built around a star-fort, and the city walls reflect that design.
